**About Radical Community Ecology:**    

> Community Ecology is a wild space with no clear boundies. The complexity of how thousands of speices sharing space and time interact across multiple trophic levels to attain a relative stable coexistance is a puzzle worth solving. We want to solve the full puzzle, rather than focussing in a few pieces. We want to, but we may fail. Yet this is not a valid reason to not try. Complex problems requires fearless radical approaches. Radical means "forming an inherent or fundamental part of the nature of something" but it also means "representing an extreme or progressive section of ideas". It captures both the solid roots of community ecology with the need to push the boundaries further. Let's unchain the power of community ecology.

Radical community Ecology is a space created by Godoy and Bartomeus labs to have fun and share projects.
